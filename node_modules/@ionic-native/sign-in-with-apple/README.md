Sign in with Apple makes it easy for users to sign in to your apps and websites using their Apple ID.
Instead of filling out forms, verifying email addresses, and choosing new passwords,
they can use Sign in with Apple to set up an account and start using your app right away.
All accounts are protected with two-factor authentication for superior security,
and Apple will not track usersâ€™ activity in your app or website.
